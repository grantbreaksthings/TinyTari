CHRGD and ON silkscreen is obscured
Makers mark on wrong side
JST connector way too small
On/Off switch will be obscured by screen. Change to right angle or move. It's also reversed (down is on, up is off)
T1 and T2 are too close together
R30 silkscreen obscured by Q1 outline
C22 needs to be change to a 1210 part
D1 too close to 6507 pins
Add a +5V and GND to power the screen
Paddle holes are too far apart
Audio source too weak, needs an amplifier before the 8k resistor (PAM8302)
Lots of video noise when sound is loud. Experiment with coax? Better board placement?
